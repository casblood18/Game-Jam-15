  Dialogue:
  - 'Praise Athena... a hero has arrived... You wield the light of Athena, a blessing
    indeed '
  - 'To reclaim the island, follow the pathway above to defeat Medusa if you dare
    face the challenge... There is a powerful magical circle in the path below that
    will help you in your journey, however, the plains have been claimed by the gorgons. '
  - 'Along your journey, you will find alchemy tables. Use them to replenish your
    strength and return to should you be felled. '
  - 'Remember, young mage, light and shadow are but two sides of the same coin. Use
    them both to your advantage. I wish you well in reclaiming our once prosperous
    lands. '
