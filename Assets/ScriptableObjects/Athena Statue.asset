  Dialogue:
  - 'Welcome, hero of shadow magic, we have been awaiting your arrival. '
  - This island, once a sanctuary of alchemists, now lies in shadow. Medusa has come
    for vengeance; her magical abilities know no bounds.
  - 'I shall grant you the light artifact, a beacon in the shadows, use it well to
    exemplify your magical abilities. '
  - 'Seek the seer in the town ahead. He will guide you on your journey. May wisdom
    light your path. '
